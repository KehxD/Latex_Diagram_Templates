# Latex_Diagram_Templates

## Project Description
This repository contains several templates for diagrams in LaTeX using TikZ. They are highly modual and simply require a list of data. For example, the code allows for easy scaling and adjusting of margins between labels. Colors are easily adjustable and contain any number of data lines. The examples down below are given with two data lines each.

## How to Run

Invoke your favorite LaTeX compiler. For example:

```
pdflatex <name>.tex
```

## Example for current Diagram Templates
![Floating Line Diargram Example](https://github.com/KehxD/Latex_Diagram_Templates/blob/master/floating_lines/float_lines_template.pdf)

![Bottom Up Line Diagram Example](https://github.com/KehxD/Latex_Diagram_Templates/blob/master/bottom_up_lines/bot_up_template.pdf)

![Bar Graph Example]
(https://github.com/KehxD/Latex_Diagram_Templates/blob/master/columns_bottom_up/bot_up_col_template.pdf)

## Current Issues
* Bar Graph with multiple bars can overlap with the longer one on top (thus obscuring the smaller one)
* Line graphs only use circles and thus only useable in color setting
* Serif Font
